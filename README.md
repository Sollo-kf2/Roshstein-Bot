## Introduction
The Screen Capture AI Experiment is a research project that investigates the capabilities of machine learning models to accurately identify objects displayed on a computer screen. The project revolves around a Python class called `ScreenCapture` designed to capture screenshots, analyze them using a pre-trained machine learning model, and take further actions based on the analysis results.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this experiment is to determine if it's possible to develop an AI model capable of predicting the presence of a golden satchel with high accuracy. The project was initiated as a thought experiment by a colleague and is now open for occasional use by the community. Feel free to utilize the code and contribute to its improvement.

## Installation
To use the Screen Capture AI Experiment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Run the `screen_capture.py` script.
2. The script will capture screenshots, analyze them using the pre-trained model, and print the prediction results.
3. If a golden satchel is detected with high confidence, the original image will be saved to the specified directory.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements or would like to report issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
